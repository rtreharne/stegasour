              	<hr class="col-md-12">

				<h2 id="sec2">You and Your Supervisor</h2>

				<p>The student-supervisor relationship is a key element in your success as a PhD student. It is important that both you and your supervisor make sufficient effort to maintain a good relationship throughout your studies. Here are a list of guidelines as to what you can expect from your supervisor and in turn what your supervisor can expect from you. The supervisor's defined role will will vary between institutions and remember that the relationship between you and your supervisor will be unique.</p>

				<h3>What you can expect from your supervisor</h3>

				<ol class="body-list">
					<li><u>Regular contact:</u> You can expect either formal or informal interaction with your supervisor on a regular basis, e.g. once a week (although once a fortnight is not unheard of).</li>
					<li><u>Guidance:</u> When you start your PhD your supervisor should give you a good idea as to how you should intitially proceed with your project. After this, your supervisor should provide further guidance as and when required. However, do not expect to receive a list of instructions on what to do - that's very much up to you.</li>
					<li><u>Feedback:</u> It is important that you receive feedback on how you are progressing with your project. Any work that you rpsent to your supervisor in the form of a presentation or report should receive some response inthe form of verbal or written comments. Some supervisors request reports at regular intervals throughout your studies, other are happy to receive updates at intervals dictated by you (within reason - daily is too often, annually is not often enough).</li>
				</ol>

				<p><strong>If there is a problem, if you are blocked or stuck in your work, if you have lost confidence, if you are experiencing domestic troubles of whatever kind, or if anything else at all is interfering with the continuation of your work, then do let your supervisors know about it. They will be able to help.</strong></p>

				<h3>What your supervisor can expect from you</h3>

				<ol class="body-list">
					<li><u>Regular contact:</u> Even if a supervisor does not request formal meetings with you on a regular basis then yous should still touch base with them frequently and let them know what you're up to. Remember, supervisors are not idiots - if you actively avoid your supervisor for weeks on end because you've hit a snag and can't present them with new results then they will know something's up. Always be honest with your supervisor. most will be acutely aware of the pitfalls of a PhD - they've had to do one too!</li>
					<li><u>Independence and Initiative:</u> Your supervisor will expect you to be able to make decisions based on your own judgement, e.g. What temperature range should I investigate> How many samples should I make? ... etc. Also, if you ever have to ask yourself <i>"what should I do now?"</i>, then don't be afraid to act on your own ideas. If you wander too far of track your supervisor will tell you so the next time you discuss your work.</li>
					<li><u>Enthusiasm:</u> If you are not excited about your research who else will be? When postgraduates are really excited about what they are doing, it stimulates those around them. Excitement is infections, and an enthusiastic student can provide a shot in the arm for even a well established research group. All projects within the CDT have been selected by the academic partners for thei high potential impact within the field of PV.This means that any new research generated by you will be highly significant to a wide community of scientists and industries.</li>
				</ol>

				<h3>Your second supervisor</h3>


				<p>If you have not been appointed a second supervisor before the start of your project then you should request that your supervisor find one for you when you do start. Your second supervisor has an important role: they should be there to give help and advice when your first supervisor is unavailable and should also be able to provide further feedback on your progress. A second supervisor is not some passive entity that only exists to satisfy the paperwork, don't be afraid to approach them with questions of either a technical or pastoral nature if you feel the need.</p>

				<p>Very often, a second supervisor  will mediate should the relationship between a student and their first supervisor become fraught. It is not uncommon for a student's first and second supervisors to swap roles during a project or for the second supervisor to find the student a new first supervisor.</p>

              	<hr class="col-md-12">

				<h2 id="sec3">Your Cohort</h2>

				<p>Obtaining a PhD can sometimes be a lonely endeavour, particularly as a student progresses through their penultimate and final years of study. The purpose of grouping the centre's students into distinct cohorts is so that there will always be a group of like-minded individuals on hand to discuss your work and problems with. A vital objective of the CDT is that a high level of communication is maintained amoungst the cohorts. Members of your own cohort, and indeed  subsequent cohorts, will share in a lot of your experiences and will be able to provide support if and when you need it. Remember, this support is a two way street and all cohort members have a responsibility to help ensure the well being of their fellow students.</p>
				
				<h3>The Role of the Cohort</h3>

				<p>
				The cohort system is unique to the Centres for Doctoral Training initiative and in addition to providing a support network for students they present significant advantages compared to those afforded to students embarking on more conventional PhD programmes. Such advantages include:</p>

				<ol class="body-list">
					<li><u>Solving technical troubles:</u> It is likely that any technical problems you encouter will also be experienced, and perhaps even solved, by other members of the cohort. It is unlikely that in these instances, where your problem involves the nitty gritty of day to day labwork that your supervisor will have the practical experience to advise you. The cohort will act as an open technical forum and be a terrific resource for problem solving. Note that this will be facilitated by the cohort network that will operate through the www.cdt-pv.org website.</li>
					<li><u>Feedback:</u> You will have plenty of opportunities to present your work to your cohort and engage in detailed technical discussions during more informal seminar events.  Your peers within the cohort will be able to provide honest and constructive feedback on your work and will expect you to provide them with the same. This type of group feedback often picks up on aspects of your work that has been overlooked or sometimes misinterpreted by a supervisor and can be extremely useful. </li>
					<li><u>Collaboration:</u> Each of the University Groups associated with the centre have a distinct set of capabilities, e.g. specific characterisation or deposition equipment, computing resources, etc. Students within the CDT are encouraged to visit cohort members at other institutions in order to engage in collaboration on an informal basis. This allows students the opportunity to greatly strengthen their own research and encourages knowledge transfer between the CDT's research groups.</li>
				</ol>

			    <h3>Cohort Mentors</h3>	

				<p>
				Each cohort will be assigned a mentor. The role of your cohort mentor is that of a trusted advisor who can provide counsel, encouragement and career advice, and also take a general interest in your development. The mentor is independent of your supervisors and takes no responsibility for the performance or assessment of your progress. Mentors may also organise social and other events for the cohort. Where students need more pastoral support the mentor may refer them to appropriate sources.</p>

				<h3>Cohort Student Representatives</h3>	

				<p>
				Each cohort will elect a student representative at the end of the first CDT training event (i.e. Liverpool, November). The cohort is responsible for administrating the election itself, i.e. handling nominations and votes, and ensuring that the process is independent of the academic members. The role of student representative will be to provide feedback on training, flag up any problems within the cohort or make requests on behalf of the cohort to the CDT board.  They will be expected to attend at least one CDT board meeting annually.</p>

              	<hr class="col-md-12">

				<h2 id="sec4">PhD Timetable</h2>

				<h3>Year 1</h3>	

				<p>
				A significant portion of your first year of study (14 weeks between November and June) will be taken up by the CDT training programme (see section \ref{sec:training}). This will involve travelling to each of the partner institutions in turn and spending up to two weeks at each location. You will also attend several showcase, seminar and industrial events throughout the year. When you are not away from your host university you will be free to work on your project. In your first year, particularly the first month or so, expect to do a lot of reading. You will need to get up to speed on the literature relevant to your project and get to grips with any bits of physics or chemistry required for you to form a critical appreciation of other people's work within the field. At the end of the first year you will be required to submit a brief literature review or report on your work to the CDT board.</p>

				<h3>Year 2</h3>

				<p>
				In your second year of study you will be free to really get to grips with your project. It is likely that you will start to plan and perform extended experiments and make deep investigations into your topic of study. You will still attend frequent training events organised by the CDT and will be required to travel around the partner institutions, however these events will be less intensive compared to those within the first year training programme and you should expect to spend no more than a few nights away from your host university each time. You might also want to think about attending national conferences and workshops to present your work. Conferences are a great way to build your list of academic contacts and to put yourself on the map within the field of PV. An updated list of upcoming PV events will be maintained at cdt-pv.org. Conferences often organise researcher workshops that are usually immediately before or after the main conference. Attending these events is a great way to meet other PhD students  and form further collaborations at institutions outside the CDT. </p>

				<p>
				At the end of your second year you will be subject to a review that will be reported to the CDT board just so that we know that you're still on track. Your supervisor will be responsible for instigating this review.</p>

				<h3>Year 3</h3>

				<p>
				Now it is likely that you will know more about the issues surrounding your specific project than anybody one else (including your supervisor). Any new research that you generate at this point will certainly be of great interest to the PV community and you should consider submitting abstracts to both national and international conferences to present your work either orally or as a poster. You will continue to perform experimental/theoretical investigations although you should be starting think about the final shape of your project and how it might look in thesis form. It is definitely recommended that you have a rough thesis plan by the end of your third year.</p>
				<p>
				You should also be encouraged to formalise your work for publication in an academic journal. Writing a scientific paper is a demanding task but is an important skill to learn. If you can publish a paper in your third or fourth years then this will significantly help you when you write your thesis. Often, it is very easy to re-work a published journal article into a distinct thesis chapter</p>

				<h3>Year 4</h3>

				<p>Now is the time to start finishing off your investigations and collating your research. If you are an experimentalist, try to resist the temptation to start new experiments. Remember, it's only a PhD! You will have plenty of opportunities to perform more experimental work if you choose to purse an academic career. The sooner you collect your research and flesh out your thesis plan the better. It is almost certain that writing your thesis will take longer than you think. As a rule of thumb, plan how long you think it will take and double it. Also, be reassured that although writing your thesis is probably one of the hardest things you will ever do, the sense of accomplishment that you get once its completed is phenomenal.</p>

              	<hr class="col-md-12">

				<h2 id="sec5">First Year Training (Core Modules)</h2>

				<p>
				The purpose of the first year curriculum is to provide specific training that is both relevant to your project and that will equip you with additional knowledge and skills that might not be gained through independent research and study. While the curriculum is specifically designed to address to field of Photovoltaics you will cover a wide range of subjects including: semiconductor and device physics, UK energy policy, entrepreneurship, nanotechnology and advanced materials. It is hoped that this training, placed within the context of your own research activities, will provide you with a very broad research outlook that most PhD candidates do not get. Furthermore the modules are specifically designed to promote student interaction within the cohort, on both professional and social levels, and it is hoped that sharing the training experience with the rest of your cohort will be an enjoyable experience. </p>


				<h3>Assessment</h3>

				<p>
				It is important that you are assessed throughout your training and that you demonstrate to the module coordinators that your learning objectives for each module have been met.</p>
				
				<h4>Points</h4>

				<p>By attending the training modules and completing the associated assessments you will be awarded 30 points (for more info on points read the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B49Gvy0kNBcwREo4MTB4V2dJQjA/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">programme specification</a>. A total of 210 points will be gained by fully completing the training curriculum after the first year.</p>

				<h4>Exams</h4>

				<p>
				Exams will typically last for 1 hour and will be sat immediately after receiving a module's lecture course. Every exam will be designated a pass mark of 50%</p>

				<h4>Written Reports, Group Reports and Presentations</h4>

				<p>
				Written reports and Group reports will adhere to the format specified by each of the module coordinators and will be submitted either directly to the coordinator or through the student portal on the CDT website.  Presentations will be given in front of the whole cohort and any other people involved with the organisation of the module. Students will receive immediate verbal feedback on their presentations from their peers within the cohort.</p>

				<h4>Requirements for passing the first year</h4>

				<p>
				There will be no minimum level of points set to determine a student's progression to the second year but the records of students with scores below 200 will be reviewed by the Academic Director. You will also have to meet the progression requirements set by each of your own university - this typically involves a written report, viva or presentation. Students will be required to provide a brief report of their research and training progress by <strong>30 Sept 2016</strong> to the Academic Director. A document explaining the requirements for this report will be emailed to all students by 30 November 2015. With this report, students are encouraged to submit to the Academic Director any reports on their research that they have written for their own institutions.</p>

				<h4>Student Feedback</h4>

				<p>
				At the end of every module you will be given the opportunity to provide honest, constructive feedback on the training that you receive through the CDT website and can do so anonymously if you wish. Any comments, complaints, suggestions that you provide will be greatly appreciated. If, for example, you feel that a particular aspect of a module doesn't work it's important that you let the us know exactly what you thought was wrong with it. We can then make then make the necessary improvements for subsequent cohorts.</p>

              	<hr class="col-md-12">

				<h2 id="sec6">Workshops & Conferences</h2>

				<p>
				You will be required to attend a variety of workshops throughout years 2 and 3 of your studies. The CDT website will be updated regularly with information concerning upcoming events and you will also be kept up to date via e-mail. </p>

				<p>
				The annual CDT Showcase will be held at each of the partner institutions in turn. All cohorts, academic partners and industry partners will be invited to attend and the event will take the form of a mini conference. All students will be expected to present their work at least once at a Showcase event.</p>

				<p>
				As mentioned above, you are free to attend national conferences and meetings throughout your PhD. It will also be your responsiblity to provide your cohort with feedback on the conferences and report on any new develepments within the field. Your conference reporting needn't be too formal and you are encouraged to make good use of social media (see below) to communicate with your cohort.</p>
				<p>
				The CDT is linked to the activities of the <a href="https://connect.innovateuk.org/web/supersolar-hub" target="_blank">SUPERGEN PV `SuperSolar' Hub</a>. This will enable students to engage more widely with the PV research community by providing access to further training events, national and international research conferences and industry forums.</p>

              	<hr class="col-md-12">

				<h2 id="sec7">Outreach</h2>
			    
				<p>Being able to communicate the issues surrounding your field to non-academic audiences is an incredibly important skill to learn. The CDT encourages its students to maintain an active outreach profile throughout their studies and engage frequently with public groups, particularly schools. One excellent way of doing this is to become a <a href="http://cdt-pv.org/files/STEM.pdf" target="_blank">STEM ambassador</a>. Them STEM network will provide you with plenty of opportunities within your local area to engage in outreach. For more information visit <a href="http://www.stemnet.org.uk" target="_blank">http://www.stemnet.org.uk</a>.</p>

				<p>
				Performing outreach is an incredibly rewarding experience and your input will directly encourage young people to consider pursuing qualifications and carrers in science and engineering. It is also an excellent opportunity for you to develop confidence and new skills that will greatly enhance your future employability.</p>
				
              	<hr class="col-md-12">

				<h2 id="sec8">Social Media</h2>

				<p>
				The use of social media throught your PhD is a double edged sword. Using sites such as LinkedIn, Research Gate and Facebook can be an excellent way to develop a network of research contacts, publicise your work and establish a reputation in the field. However, remember that your attention is a limited resource, and a PhD requires that your focus your attention intensely on the problems that arise in your research and writing. <strong>This has to take priority</strong>, so be careful when investing your time and attention in social media. Make sure it does not distract you from the main task at hand - your PhD.</p>

				<p>
				That said, here are a few examples of how social media can be of benefit to the CDT:</p>

				<ul class="body-list">
					<li><u>Conference Reporting:</u> It is impossible for the CDT to send every student to every PV conference. Using Twitter to report directly on talks that you attend during a conference mean that the rest of your cohort can share in your expeience without leaving their own host institutions. Check out the <a href="http://blog.sli.do/ultimate-guide-to-live-tweeting-at-conferences" target="_blank">Sli.Do</a> guide to live tweeting at conferences.</li>
					<li><u>Videos and podcasts:</u> Sometimes, describing a tricky technical process via e-mail can be difficult. Posting video or audio recordings that document technical aspects of your work can be of great beneft to other members of the cohort engaged in similar work. More general videos that provide an overall outlook on your research or a description of your group's capabilities can also greatly improve your collaboration potential.</li>
					<li><u>Feeback</u>: Through twitter, you can provide instant feedback on your CDT experience. Your comments and suggetstions will be appreciated. By following \href{http://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=cdtpv}{@cdtpv} you can also be kept up to date with all developments within the centre.  </li>
				</ul>
              	<hr class="col-md-12">
